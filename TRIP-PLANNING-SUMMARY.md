# Summary: Paris Trip Planning Recommendations

## What Was Completed

I've created comprehensive Paris recommendations for your trip (April 23-27, 2026) staying in the Latin Quarter. Here's what's included:

### 1. paris-recommendations.md
A detailed reference guide containing:

**Things to Do (10+ recommendations)**
- Major attractions in the Latin Quarter (Panthéon, Shakespeare and Company, Musée de Cluny, etc.)
- Walking routes and hidden gems (Rue Mouffetard, medieval streets, Roman amphitheater)
- Gardens and parks (Jardin du Luxembourg)
- Events happening during April 23-27, 2026:
  - Major concerts at Accor Arena, La Défense Arena, Zénith, etc.
  - Classical music and opera at Opéra Bastille, Palais Garnier
  - Art exhibitions at Louvre, Musée d'Orsay, Centre Pompidou
  - Spring festivals (Tuileries Carnival, Paris Jazz Festival)
  - Versailles Musical Fountain Shows

**Restaurants (10 recommendations)**
- Classic French bistros (La Petite Périgourdine, Le Petit Prince de Paris, Bistro des Augustins)
- Upscale/Michelin dining (Tour d'Argent, Alliance)
- Market-fresh casual spots (L'Atelier Artisan Crêpier, Les Papilles)
- International cuisine (Moroccan, fusion sushi, Tunisian-Italian)

All recommendations are:
- Located in or near the Latin Quarter
- Accessible by walking and public transportation (Metro lines 4, 10, RER B)
- Suitable for the April 2026 timeframe

### 2. sub-issues-to-create.md
Ready-to-use templates for creating sub-issues in GitHub:
- 10 sub-issues for Issue #44 (🎉 Things to Do)
- 10 sub-issues for Issue #46 (🍴 Restaurants)

Each sub-issue includes:
- Pre-formatted title
- Detailed body with location, access, specialties, pricing, and notes
- Easy copy-paste format

### 3. README.md Updates
Added a "Planning Resources" section under the Paris itinerary with links to:
- The comprehensive recommendations document
- The sub-issues creation guide
- Note about staying in the Latin Quarter

## Why Sub-Issues Aren't Automatically Created

The GitHub API tools available to me provide read-only access to issues. I cannot programmatically:
- Create new issues
- Create sub-issues
- Modify issue bodies or task lists

This is a security limitation to prevent unauthorized changes to your repository.

## How to Create the Sub-Issues

You have two options:

### Option 1: Manual Creation via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to https://github.com/holly-kassel/Europe-2026/issues
2. Open Issue #44 (🎉 Things to Do) or #46 (🍴 Restaurants)
3. Look for the option to create sub-issues (if your repository has this feature enabled)
4. Copy the title and body text from `sub-issues-to-create.md` for each sub-issue
5. Create each one

### Option 2: Create as Regular Issues with References
If sub-issues aren't available:
1. Click "New Issue" in the Issues tab
2. Use the title from `sub-issues-to-create.md`
3. Copy the body text
4. Add "Part of #44" or "Part of #46" to link it to the parent issue
5. Optionally add labels like "Paris" or "Latin Quarter" for organization

## Next Steps

1. Review the recommendations in `paris-recommendations.md`
2. Use `sub-issues-to-create.md` to add sub-issues to Issues #44 and #46
3. Book tickets/reservations as needed (especially for:
   - Concerts and shows (book early!)
   - Tour d'Argent and Alliance restaurants (Michelin-starred, need advance reservations)
   - Major art exhibitions (purchase tickets online)
4. Check specific schedules closer to your travel dates for concerts and exhibitions

## Questions or Changes Needed?

If you need:
- Different types of recommendations
- More or fewer options
- Changes to the format
- Additional research on specific venues or events

Just let me know and I can update the documents accordingly!
